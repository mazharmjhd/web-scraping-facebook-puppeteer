Since version 1.7.0 we publish the puppeteer-core package, a version of Puppeteer that doesn't download Chromium by default.

npm i puppeteer-core
# or "yarn add puppeteer-core"
puppeteer-core is intended to be a lightweight version of Puppeteer for launching an existing browser installation or for connecting to a remote one.
Be sure that the version of puppeteer-core you install is compatible with the browser you intend to connect to.
